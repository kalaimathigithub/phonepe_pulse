# Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration

## Overview

This project aims to create a user-friendly tool for visualizing and exploring Phonepe Pulse data using Streamlit and Plotly. The tool facilitates data extraction, processing, database management, and dynamic updating to provide an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.

## Learning Outcomes

1. **Data Extraction and Processing:**
   - Utilize Clone GitHub to extract data from the Phonepe Pulse repository.
   - Employ Python libraries, especially Pandas, for effective data pre-processing.

2. **Database Management:**
   - Implement a relational database, MySQL, to efficiently store and retrieve Phonepe Pulse data.

3. **Visualization and Dashboard Creation:**
   - Utilize Streamlit and Plotly libraries to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.

4. **Geo Visualization:**
   - Implement Plotly's built-in geo map functions for creating and displaying geographical visualizations.

5. **Dynamic Updating:**
   - Develop a dashboard that dynamically updates based on the latest Phonepe Pulse data in the database.

6. **Project Development and Deployment:**
   - Create a comprehensive and user-friendly solution, from data extraction to dashboard deployment.
   - Implement testing and deployment procedures to ensure security, efficiency, and user-friendliness.
